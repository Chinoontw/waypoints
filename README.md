**New Features :sparkles:**

- **Handles Multiple JSON Structures:** The extractor now correctly handles JSON files where waypoints are either directly in the main dictionary or within a list, providing more flexibility with the input format.

**Improvements :tools:**

- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Improved error handling for invalid JSON files and waypoints missing the required keys. Error messages are now more specific and displayed in the console output.
- **Empty Waypoint List Handling:** If no waypoints are found, an empty `waypoints.json` file is still created to prevent potential errors.
- **Accurate Color Extraction:** The extractor now correctly extracts the `Color` value from the input JSON files.
